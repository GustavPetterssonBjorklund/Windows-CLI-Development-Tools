# Windows CLI development tools

## This is a collection of tools that I use for development on Windows. I have been using Windows for development for a long time and I have found these tools to be very useful. I hope you find them useful too.

## - To install these tools:
### 1. Clone the repository
``` powershell 
https://github.com/GustavPetterssonBjorklund/win_dev_tools.git
```
### 2. Set a path for the bin folder in the repository
``` powershell 
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\path\to\win_dev_tools\bin"
```
### - Recommended setup:
### - Edit bin/touch.conf to set your name and email for file creation
